# Core Java Apps
This project category consists of the two Java applications below

1. [Java Grep App](./grep)

# Introduction

This project implements a simple **Java Grep** application that searches through files in a directory to find lines that match a given regular expression (regex). The design of the application is based on core **Java** concepts, including **IO operations** (reading and writing files), **regular expressions**, and **file traversal**. It uses a **Docker** container for easy deployment, ensuring portability across systems. The project also leverages **lambda expressions** and **streams** for efficient data processing. The application is developed using an **IDE** (e.g., **IntelliJ IDEA**), and packaged into a **JAR file** for distribution.

2. [Stock Quote App](./stockquote)
