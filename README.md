**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AmadouSy/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AmadouSy/tree/develop/linux_sql)]: This project implement a Linux Cluster Monitor application using Bash and PostgreSQL to collect, store, and analyze real-time hardware resource data. Utilized Docker for easy deployment, enhancing portability and consistency across different environments. Developed scripts to automate data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), and created SQL queries for efficient data management and reporting.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AmadouSy/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AmadouSy/blob/feature/core_java/core_java)]:
      
  - JDBC App: Implemented a Java application leveraging JDBC to connect, interact, and perform CRUD operations with a PostgreSQL database. Designed data access objects (DAOs) for clean and efficient data handling, utilized Maven for build management, and Docker to simplify the application setup and deployment process. Conducted thorough testing to ensure reliability, stability, and accuracy of database transactions.
  - Grep App: This project implements a simple Java Grep application that searches through files in a directory to find lines that match a given regular expression (regex). The design of the application is based on core Java concepts, including IO operations (reading and writing files), regular expressions, and file traversal. It uses a Docker container for easy deployment, ensuring portability across systems. The project also leverages lambda expressions and streams for efficient data processing. The application is developed using an IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA), and packaged into a JAR file for distribution.
  - Stockquote App: Developed a Java-based Stock Quote application using JDBC and PostgreSQL to manage and analyze stock market data efficiently. Leveraged Maven for dependency management and Docker for application portability and streamlined deployment. Implemented comprehensive unit tests with JUnit to ensure code reliability and correctness. Demonstrated proficiency in object-oriented programming, database connectivity, and data processing
