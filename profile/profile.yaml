      - "JDBC App: Implemented a Java application leveraging JDBC to connect, interact, and perform CRUD operations with a PostgreSQL database. Designed data access objects (DAOs) for clean and efficient data handling, utilized Maven for build management, and Docker to simplify the application setup and deployment process. Conducted thorough testing to ensure reliability, stability, and accuracy of database transactions."
      - "Grep App: This project implements a simple Java Grep application that searches through files in a directory to find lines that match a given regular expression (regex). The design of the application is based on core Java concepts, including IO operations (reading and writing files), regular expressions, and file traversal. It uses a Docker container for easy deployment, ensuring portability across systems. The project also leverages lambda expressions and streams for efficient data processing. The application is developed using an IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA), and packaged into a JAR file for distribution."
